## ✨ Etch-a-Sketch - Interactive Grid Drawing App

A browser-based sketchpad built with **HTML**, **CSS (Flexbox)**, and **JavaScript**, part of ODIN PROJECT course.

### 🚀 Features

* 🎨 Dynamically generates a **16×16 grid** of square divs using JavaScript.
* ✏️ Squares change color when hovered over, leaving a **"pixelated trail"** like a digital pen.
* 📏 A **“New Grid”** button prompts the user to enter a number of squares per side (up to 100), replacing the existing grid while maintaining the overall width (1250px) — perfect for sketching with finer or coarser resolution.* 🧠 Uses **Flexbox** for layout (as part of a learning objective), avoiding CSS Grid.

### 🛠 Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3 with Flexbox
* JavaScript (DOM manipulation + events)

### 📝 How to Use

1. Open the webpage.
2. Hover your mouse over the grid to draw.
3. Click the **"New Grid"** button to choose a different resolution.
